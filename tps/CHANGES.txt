0.3.4a by Ken Brazier
	- Minor code change to allow compilation on non-x86.  No effect on x86.
	- Commented out qmax in tpconfig.txt

0.3.4 by Ken Brazier
	- 10-15% improvement for SSE2, for most inputs.  Otherwise drops
		back to the older SSE2 code automatically.

0.3.2 by Ken Brazier
	- 32-bit SSE2 version
	- Tweaks for 32-bit non-SSE2 version, such as BSFQ macro
	- Quiet flag

0.3.0 New algorithm for sieving wide n ranges based on idea by Ken Brazier.
      The n range is traversed in steps of size m, where kmax*2^m < pmin.
      E.g. for the current TPS project where kmax < 2^20, sieving for
      factors p between 2^50 and 2^51 can be done in steps of size 31.


0.2.5 Keep factors file open between writes, flush it when checkpointing.

      Allow APP_BUFLEN >= 8

      Main version 0.2.4


0.2.4 Fixed a bug where nmax was not being correctly set from a multi-n file.


0.2.3 Hint to compiler to use a conditional move to avoid a 50/50 branch in
      the left-right powmod. Thanks to Ken Brazier for this idea.

      Left-right powmod is now faster than right-left in 64-bit mode too,
      so remove the right-left code altogether.

      Allow APP_BUFLEN=7


0.2.2 Allow the input file to be in ABCD format.
      New tp_abcd program to convert from NewPGen to ABCD format.

      Main version 0.2.3


0.2.1 Fixed invalid header error for valid input files.

      Compute 2^{-n} mod p using a left to right powmod in 32-bit mode.


0.2.0 Added nmax option for sieving a range nmin <= n <= nmax.

      Added restriction kmax < pmin.


0.1.2 Set FPU mode in each child thread.


0.1.1 Fixed segfault when no input file.

      Use kmin <= k <= kmax instead of kmin <= k < kmax.


0.1.0 Release for testing.
