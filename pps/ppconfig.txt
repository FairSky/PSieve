# Sieve block size, in bytes. Should not exceed L2 cache size.
#blocksize=512k

# Sieve chunk size, in bytes. Smaller chunks require more communication
# between threads but result in less time wasted when threads must
# synchronise, e.g. for checkpoints and program termination.
#chunksize=8k

# Sieve candidate factors using primes up to qmax. Default is sqrt(pmax).
# For large N ranges, leave this at the default.
#qmax=10e6

# Deactivate or attempt to force use of the "alternate algorithm".
#
# No =	Never use the alternate algorithm.
# Yes =	Try very hard to use the alternate (SSE2/x86-64) algorithm.
# 	It is never activated if K >= 2^32 or K*P >= 2^64.
# Bench=On 64-bit, benchmark and try to find the best algorithm.
# 	On 32-bit SSE2, same as Yes.  (Default in both cases.)
